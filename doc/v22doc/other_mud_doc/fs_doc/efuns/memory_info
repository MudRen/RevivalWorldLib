     memory_info - obtain info on object/overall memory usage

語法
     varargs int memory_info( object ob );

描述
     If optional argument `ob' is  given,  memory_info()  returns
     the  approximate amount of memory that `ob' is using.  If no
     argument is given,  memory_info()  returns  the  approximate
     amount  of  memory  that the entire mud is using.  Note that
     the amount of memory the mud is using does  not  necessarily
     correspond to the amount of memory actually allocated by the
     mud from the system.

reload_object(3)      LPC 系統函數      reload_object(3)

名稱
     reload_object - return an object to its just-loaded state

語法
     void reload_object( object ob );

描述
     When reload_object() is called  on  `ob',  all  the  driver-
     maintained   properties   are   re-initialized  (heart_beat,
     call_outs, light,  shadows,  etc),  all  variables  are  re-
     initialized,  and  create()  is  called.   It  has a similar
     effect to destructing/reloading the object, however, no disk
     access or parsing is performed.

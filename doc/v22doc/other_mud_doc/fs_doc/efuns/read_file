名稱
     read_file() - read a file into a string

語法
     string read_file( string file, int start_line,
                       int number_of_lines );

描述
     Read a line of text from a file into a string.   The  second
     and  third  arguments are optional.  If only the first argu-
     ment is  specified,  the  entire  file  is  returned  (as  a
     string).

     The start_line is the line number of the line  you  wish  to
     read.   This  routine  will return 0 if you try to read past
     the end of the file, or if you try to read from  a  nonposi-
     tive line.

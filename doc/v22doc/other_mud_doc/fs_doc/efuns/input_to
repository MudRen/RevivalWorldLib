input_to(3)           LPC 系統函數           input_to(3)

名稱
     input_to() - causes next line of  input  to  be  sent  to  a
     specified function

語法
     varargs void input_to( string | function fun, int flag,  ...
     );

描述
     Enable next line of user input to be sent to the local func-
     tion `fun' as an argument. The input line will not be parsed
     by the driver.

     Note that input_to is  non-blocking  which  means  that  the
     object  calling  input_to  does not pause waiting for input.
     Instead the object continues to execute any statements  fol-
     lowing  the input_to.  The specified function `fun' will not
     be called until the user input has been collected.

     If "input_to()" is called more than once in the same  execu-
     tion, only the first call has any effect.

     If optional argument `flag' is non-zero, the line  given  by
     the  player  will  not be echoed, and is not seen if snooped
     (this is useful for collecting passwords).

     The function `fun' will be called with the user input as its
     first argument (a string). Any additional arguments supplied
     to input_to will be passed on to `fun' as arguments  follow-
     ing the user input.

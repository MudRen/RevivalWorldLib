replace_program(3)    LPC 系統函數    replace_program(3)

名稱
     replace_program() - replaces the program in this_object()

語法
     void replace_program( string str );

描述
     replace_program() replaces the program in this_object() with
     that  of  an object it inherits.  The string argument is the
     filename of the object whose program is to  be  used.   Once
     the  replacement takes place, the current object effectively
     becomes a clone of that other object, but with  its  current
     filename  and  global  variable  values.  The program is not
     actually replaced until the current execution is completed.

resolve(3)            LPC 系統函數            resolve(3)

名稱
     resolve() - resolve an internet address to domain  name,  or
     vice versa

語法
     int resolve( string address, string callback_func );

描述
     resolve() resolves `address', which should  be  an  internet
     address  in  the form "127.0.0.1" or a domain name, into its
     domain name, or internet address.  When the resolve is  com-
     plete, `callback_func' will be called in the current object.
     The form of the callback is:

     void callback(string address, string resolved, int key);

     `key' will match  up  with  the  number  that  the  call  to
     resolve()  returned.   `address'  will be the domain name of
     the host, and `resolved' the dotted decimal ip address.  The
     unknown value will be 0 if the lookup failed.

     query_ip_number(3)

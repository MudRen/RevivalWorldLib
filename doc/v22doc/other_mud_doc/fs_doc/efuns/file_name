file_name(3)          LPC 系統函數          file_name(3)

名稱
     file_name() - get the file name of an object

語法
     string file_name( object ob );

描述
     file_name() returns the name of the file from which <ob> was
     loaded.   If the object is a cloned object, then file_name()
     will not be an actual file on disk, but will be the name  of
     the  file  from  which  the  object  was  originally cloned,
     appended with an octothorpe  (#)  and  the  object  instance
     number.  Object instance numbers start at 0 when the game is
     booted, and increase by one for each  object  cloned,  hence
     the  number is unique for each cloned object.  <ob> defaults
     to this_object() if not specified.

reclaim_objects(3)    LPC 系統函數    reclaim_objects(3)

名稱
     reclaim_objects - reclaim any lingering objets

語法
     int reclaim_objects( void );

描述
     Cycles through all objects that are loaded,  and  frees  any
     lingering  objects that it can.  This could result in a siz-
     able amount of memory being freed up, depending on  how  the
     mud  is  coded.  Objects are typically left lingering when a
     global variable in more than one object contains  a  pointer
     to  it,  and  the object gets destructed.  This efun returns
     the number of destructed objects encountered in variables.

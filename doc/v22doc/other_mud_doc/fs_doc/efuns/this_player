this_player(3)        LPC 系統函數        this_player(3)

語法
     object this_player( int flag );

描述
     Return the object representing the player  that  caused  the
     calling  function to be called.  Note that this_player() may
     return a different value than this_object() even when called
     from  within  a  player object.  If this_player is called as
     this_player(1) then the returned value will be the  interac-
     tive   that  caused  the  calling  function  to  be  called.
     this_player(1)   may   return   a   different   value   than
     this_player()  in  certain  cases (such as when command() is
     used by an admin to force a player to perform some command).

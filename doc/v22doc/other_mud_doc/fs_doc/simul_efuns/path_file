PATH_FILE(2)               silmul_efun               PATH_FILE(2)

名稱
     path_file - 從完整的路徑檔名字串中取回檔名跟路徑

語法
     mixed *path_file(mixed full_path);

描述
     Given a full pathname in full_path, this simul_efun  returns
     a  2-element  array,  of which the first element is the path
     name up to (but not including) the file name, and the second
     element  is the file name.  If full_path is an array of full
     pathnames, path_file calls itself recursively,  returning  a
     2-element  array where the first element is an array of path
     names (not including the file names) and the second  element
     is an array of file names.

     EXAMPLE:  path_file("/adm/simul_efun/path_file.c")   returns
     the array ({ "/adm/simul_efun/", "path_file.c" }).

     path_file(({ "/a/b/c/file1.c", "/d/e/f/file2.c" }))  returns
     an  array for which element 0 is ({ "/a/b/c/", "/d/e/f/" }),
     and element 1 is ({ "file1", "file2" }).

名稱
     substr - 搜尋並取代字串

語法
     string substr(string str, string match, string replace);

描述
     From Sulam's comments in the original file:

     This function recursively replaces a key with a string.

     Variables: str      The text  that  needs  formatting  match
     The  key  that  is getting replaced replace  What to replace
     match with Returns: The string we end up with.

     Note: this is very similar to replace_string().  As they are
     both slightly different, they are both here until a suitable
     solution can be found.

     例子
        substr("abcbdbebf", "b", "-") returns "a-c-d-e-f"

其它參考函數
     replace_string().

     msg_target,
                     string extra);

描述
     This efun implements the emote command by passing the "msg_"
     strings  to  the  appropriate  players, as described in more
     detail below.

     ARGUMENTS

     sender      -  the  player  who  issued  the  emote  command
     msg_self   - the string to be parsed and sent back to sender
     msg_others - the string to be parsed and displayed to others
     in
                     the same room target     -  the  player  (or
     other living object) that receives
                     (is the victim of?) the action being emoted.
     This
                     argument may be omitted for  emoted  actions
     that
                     have no target.  msg_target - the string  to
     be parsed and displayed to the target.
                     If there is no target, this argument will be
                     ignored.  extra      - an extra string  that
     will replace "{M}" in any of the
                     "msg_" strings (see next section)

     PARSING

     Within the  msg_self  string,  certain  substrings  will  be
     automatically replaced, as follows:
         {n}     - the name of target
         {o}     - the objective form of target's name
         {p}     - the possessive form of target's name
         {M}     - the "extra" argument, as noted above
             (Note:  if either target or msg_target are not used,
     this
              efun will send msg_self back to sender without mak-
     ing the
              substitutions listed above)

     Within msg_others, the following substutions will be made:
         {N}     - the name of sender
         {O}     - the objective form of sender's name
